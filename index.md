# help with [kitmail](http://zensprojects.ct8.pl/) 
##### also known as zensprojectsMail

## logging in
if you were given an @zensprojects.ct8.pl email by [me](mailto:kit1@zensprojects.ct8.pl), you can just use the username 
(e.g. if your email was amogus@zensprojects.ct8.pl, you can just enter the username *amogus*.)

if you want to login with a [gmail](https://mail.google.com/) or an [outlook](https://outlook.live.com) account, you do have to apply the end of the email. 
(e.g. amogus@gmail.com would still be amogus@gmail.com)

## themes
##### *note: themes are not available on mobile mode.*

To change one's theme, all you have to do is select *themes* in settings.
